# ElswordListManager

A discord bot that is used to keep track of the current state of your Elsword's dailies and weeklies.<br>
Declare your classes and objectives and the bot will handle everything for you, counting completion and resetting at the same time as the servers.<br>
<br>
You will need a discord application and bot declared on ```https://discord.com/developers/applications```, to change the login code by your bot id at the very bottom of ```ElswordRaidManager.js``` and invite your bot on your server<br>
Then run the ```npm install && npm start``` command to start the bot, then use the ```??help``` command on your server to learn about the bot commands
